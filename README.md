## About

Carbmeter is an open-source tool for estimating the carbon footprint of a wallet or web3 protocol on Starknet L2 and Ethereum L1. With Carbmeter, you can easily calculate and track the environmental impact of your transactions and smart contract deployments.

Our tool uses advanced algorithms and data analysis to estimate the carbon footprint of your actions on the blockchain, taking into account factors such as energy consumption, network usage, and computational complexity. Carbmeter also provides a user-friendly interface for visualizing and understanding your carbon footprint.

Carbmeter is designed to be easy to use and integrate into existing workflow, making it simple for developers, organizations, and individuals to measure and reduce their environmental impact.

Our team is committed to promoting sustainability and reducing the environmental impact of the blockchain industry. By using Carbmeter, you can make informed decisions about your use of blockchain technology and take steps to reduce your carbon footprint.
